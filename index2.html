            <p class="text1" >Does your cat look like Adolf Hitler? Do you wake up in a cold sweat every night wondering if he's going to up and
            invade Poland? Does he keep putting his right paw in the air while making a noise that sounds suspiciously like "Sieg
            Miaow"? If so, this is the website for you.
            </p>
            <p class="text1">How did you end up here? Did you write in Google “Hitler cats” or “cats that look like Hitler”? Why would you search for
            such a weird thing? Are you really THAT bored at work? Anyways… Some cats just want to do the usual cat things like
            playing, sleeping, or catching birds. These cats, however, want to invade Poland. We call them Kitlers.</p>
            <p class="text1">No no no! These cats have that hilarious Charlie Chaplin moustache! Let’s not try to load all our human negativity on
            our furry, cuddly feline companions, please! Being loners, they have never mobilized armies against their neighbors nor
            set up a factory system to exterminate cats who were different from them.</p>
            <p class="text1">My name is craig tucker. last week was my birthday. my grandma gave me a check for 100 dollars. I was so happy. But
            then, 4 kids from school came to my house and said I should invest my 100 into becoming a peruvian flute band. They said
            I would double my money in one afternoon. But the government arrested us, along with all the other peruvian flute bands.
            we begged to go home, but the government said they were sending us to peru. so that is why I am now in peru, if I die,
            let it be known that it is because 4 guys from school I don’t even like lied to me and stole my birthday money</p>

            <p class="text1">Eobard Thawne, also known as the Reverse-Flash and Professor Zoom, is a supervillain appearing in American comic books
            published by DC Comics. Created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino</p>
            <p class="text1">The character first appeared in The Flash #139 (September 1963) and has since endured as the archenemy of Barry Allen /
            The Flash. Thawne is the first and most well-known character to assume the Reverse-Flash mantle, and is additionally
            a descendant of Malcolm Thawne and ancestor of Bart Allen, Thaddeus Thawne and Owen Mercer.</p>
            <p class="text1">Thawne is a fanatical admirer of The Flash who, after discovering that he is destined to become a villainous speedster,
            travels back in time from the 25th century to meet his idol. Using his knowledge of the future, Thawne assumes the
            identity of the Flash's long-standing archenemy, Professor Zoom, and travels back in time to battle his idol. After being
            defeated, Thawne attempts to return to his own time but overshoots, winding up further in the past, where he discovers
            that he is destined to become the Flash's greatest enemy.</p>
